# FindVentory - A simple web frontend <br> for inventory management

"FindVentory" is a portmanteau of "to find" and "inventory".

To run this software, you will need: <br>

1) A web browser of your choice <br>
2) XAMPP <br>


Just copy all the repository contents into the XAMPP folder "htdocs" and start the Apache and MySQL servers in the XAMPP control panel. <br>
Start the software by entering "localhost/HTML" into the URL bar of your browser. <br>
Have fun inventorizing ;)

Note: <br> 
The GUI language can be toggled between English and German in the bottom left corner on the main page. <br>
